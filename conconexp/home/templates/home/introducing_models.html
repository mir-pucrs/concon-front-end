                                            In this model, we break potential conflict identification into two steps.
                                            First, we retrieve information from the contract in order to identify the parties involved and the norms it contains.
                                            Second, we use such information to compare norms and identify potential conflicts.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            In the information retrieval step, we use rules to identify (in the first paragraph of the contract) the parties in the contract.
                                            We identify norms within the text simply using a set of modal verbs, thus, if a modal verb exists in a sentence, we classify it as a norm.
                                            Finally, we compare the parties, the modal verb (and its deontic meaning), and the norm action and, using conflict rules, we identify which ones are potential conflicts.
                                        </p>

                                            In this model, we use a CNN to process norm pairs and classify them as conflicts.
                                            We use a matrix representation that computes a character-level similarity between two norms as input to the CNN.
                                            To train our model, we use a set of conflicting norm pairs manually labeled and a set of non-conflicting norm pairs.
