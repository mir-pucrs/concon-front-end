Notwithstanding Section 17.1, above, SUPPLIER is not obligated to defend, indemnify or hold harmless VA LINUX, its Representatives, Contract manufacturers, independent contractors, and/or customers if such infringement claim would not have arisen but for: (a) SUPPLIER's incorporation of VA LINUXsupplied designs, VA LINUXsupplied Specifications and/or VA LINUXdesigned Components; (b) VA LINUX combination of the Product with other devices, products and/or software, not supplied by SUPPLIER, and but for the combination, the Product, by itself, would not infringe; (c) modifications made to the Product unless at SUPPLIER's direction; and/or (d) the installation or use of the Product contrary to the Documentation provided by SUPPLIER. 17.3 Remedy for Infringement. If the design or manufacture of the Product, or any portion thereof, for which SUPPLIER is responsible is finally adjudged, or in SUPPLIER's reasonable opinion is likely to be adjudged, to infringe a patent, copyright, mask work right, trademark, trade secret, or any other intellectual property right of any third party, SUPPLIER shall, at its option: (a) procure the right to continue manufacturing, assembling, packaging, testing and selling of the Product; or (b) modify the Product so that it becomes noninfringing, provided that the same function is performed by the replacement or modified units and the replacement or modified units have substantially the same quality as the infringing units. If SUPPLIER elects option (b), above, then SUPPLIER shall replace all infringing units at SUPPLIER's cost and expense. If neither (a) nor (b), above, is available to SUPPLIER on reasonable terms, then VA LINUX may terminate this Agreement for cause. VA LINUX shall return to SUPPLIER, at SUPPLIER's cost and expense, any infringing Product, and SUPPLIER shall refund the purchase price of the returned Product, subject to depreciation on a threeyear straight line basis. 17.4 SECTIONS 17.1, 17.2, AND 17.3 STATE THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF THE PARTIES, AND THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE PARTIES, FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT OF ANY PATENT, COPYRIGHT, MASK WORK RIGHT, TRADEMARK, OR ANY OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY. 18.0.

SUPPLIER may choose to participate with VA LINUX in the defense of such claim at its own expense, but such participation shall be without prejudice to SUPPLIER's right to reimbursement from VA LINUX of reasonable costs, expenses (including reasonable fees of attorneys and other retained professionals prior to SUPPLIER's participation), and awarded damages of any kind that SUPPLIER may have been ordered to pay as a result of such claim. 18.5 Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 16, 17, AND 18.4 ABOVE, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OTHER PARTY FOR THE OTHER PARTY'S SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS) HOWEVER *Redacted; confidential treatment requested.

Nothing herein or in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be construed as, or deemed to be, the formation of a partnership, association, joint venture or similar entity by or among the Parties hereto.

Any attempted assignment in violation of the provisions of this Section 20.6 shall be void. 20.7 Subcontracting. It is understood and agreed that SUPPLIER subcontracts its obligations to manufacture, assemble, package, and test the Product. 20.8 Equitable Relief. Because the services are personal and unique, and because the Parties shall have access to and become acquainted with Confidential Information of the other Party, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which would cause irreparable harm and significant injury which would be difficult to ascertain and which would not be compensable by damages alone, the Parties agree that, in addition to any other remedy available to either Party at law or in equity (e.g., injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief), the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, as set forth in Section 16.0, shall be enforceable under the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act, California Civil Code Section 3426, as amended. 20.9 Compliance with Laws and Regulations. Each Party shall comply with all applicable federal, provincial, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, the regulations of the U.S. and local governments relating to the export of commodities and technical data insofar as they relate to the activities under this Agreement.

SUPPLIER's employees shall have been trained to properly, safely and legally handle hazardous materials and wastes. SUPPLIER shall notify VA LINUX, by FAX transmission or email, immediately of the discovery of any regulatory action taken or initiated against SUPPLIER, whether or not such action relates to or arises out of this Agreement, that may result in fines or penalties, prosecution or that may impact SUPPLIER's ability to deliver Product under this Agreement. Such regulatory compliance and management of SUPPLIER's employees, facilities and processes shall be solely SUPPLIER's responsibility. 20.11 Resolution of Disputes. The Parties agree that they will make good faith efforts to settle any dispute, claim or controversy (a "Dispute") arising out of or relating to this Agreement by discussion and negotiation. If such efforts fail to resolve a Dispute, the Parties agree that, after a Party makes a written request to the other Party, the Parties will choose a mutually acceptable mediator to conduct a mediation between the Parties in order to resolve such Dispute. The Parties will establish by mutual written agreement the procedures under that such mediation will be conducted, and agree that: (a) neither Party may unreasonably withhold its approval of the other Party's nomination of a mediator or proposal for the use of a procedure, (b) the Parties will share equally in the cost of any such mediation, and (c) each Party will assign a person as its representative in such mediation. If the Parties are unable to resolve any Dispute by mediation within ninety (90) Calendar Days after the date of a Party's initial request for mediation, either Party may seek an adjudicated resolution of such Dispute through a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that nothing will prevent either Party from availing itself of a judicial proceeding Page 18 of 20 20 earlier if it believes in good faith that injunctive relief is necessary to prevent it from incurring serious and irreparable harm. The Parties agree that the use of any alternative method of dispute resolution shall not be construed: (i) under the doctrines of laches, estoppel or waiver to adversely affect the rights of either Party, or (ii) as a waiver of the statute of limitations with respect to any right of action related to any Dispute. All discussions and negotiations pursuant to this provision shall be treated as confidential by the Parties, and as compromise and settlement discussions for purposes of applicable rules of evidence. 20.12 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, excluding its choice of law rules. The Parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not govern this Agreement nor the rights and obligations of the Parties. Any dispute, claim or controversy between the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or relating to the Product, may be brought in the California state courts in and for Santa Clara, County, California (or, if there is federal jurisdiction, the U.S. District Court serving Santa Clara County), and VA LINUX and SUPPLIER agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts. 20.13 Notices.
