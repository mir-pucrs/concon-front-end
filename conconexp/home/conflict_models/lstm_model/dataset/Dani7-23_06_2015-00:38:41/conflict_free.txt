For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
GROSS INEQUITIES 9.1 It is the further intent of the parties hereto that they shall mutually benefit from the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, and in the event that either party shall suffer a gross inequity resulting from such terms, conditions or provisions, or from a substantial change in circumstances or conditions, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve or remove such inequity.
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
It is mutually understood and agreed, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to relieve either party of any of its obligations under this Agreement, unless and until such changes have been agreed to in writing by both parties.
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
PAYMENT 10.1 Celgene will remit payment in U.S. dollars within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice.
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
Celgene agrees to pay an interest charge equal to one and onehalf percent (1.5%) per month on the unpaid balance on any invoice.
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
10.2 Price Charges The price of Material shall be automatically subject to price escalation on the first day of each calendar year beginning with January 1, 2002, by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the producer price index ("PPI").
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
The PPI referenced herein shall be determined from Table VI of the Producer Prices and Price Index, commodity code 063 for drugs and pharmaceuticals, Bureau of Labor Statistics (or if discontinued such equivalent index as is mutually agreed to by the parties).
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
The percentage change in the PPI shall be determined by dividing the final annual average PPI for the immediately preceding calendar year by the final annual average PPI for the next preceding calendar year.
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
For example, the price increase effective January 1, in year X would be determined under the above formula by dividing the final annual average from calendar year X1 by the final annual average PPI from calendar year X2.
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
If such percentage change is less than zero percent (0.00%), the prices shall remain unchanged.
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
10.3 Any present or future duty, sales, use, excise or other taxes other than taxes on income, whether Federal, State or local, applicable to this transaction are not included in the price herein stated and when due shall be paid by Celgene without cost or charge to JMI.
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
DEA quotas are limited, therefore, in order to assure Celgene of the supplies agreed to hereunder, JMI agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain DEA manufacturing quota and Celgene shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with JMI's request for manufacturing quota and obtain DEA procurement quota sufficient to allow JMI to process Celgene orders for Material.
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
Neither party shall be liable to the other for that quantity of Material which the other party is unable to supply or take as a result of failure to obtain the necessary DEA quota so long as it has used reasonable best efforts to obtain sufficient DEA quota.
For example, if Celgene anticipates FDA approval in April of 2001, Celgene shall provide in December, 2000 a firm order for Material for April, May and June for 2001 and a forecast for Material requirements for July, 2001 through March, 2002.
