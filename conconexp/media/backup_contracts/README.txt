Repository containing the code and corpora used in the potential
conflict identifier.

Code
----

The code is organized as follows:

-  In folder *code*, we have all code used to execute the potential
   conflict identifier;

-  The processes are divided into subfolders, namely:

   -  *norm\_identification*

   -  *party\_identification*

   -  *sentence\_similarity*

-  Inside *code*, we have the *data* folder, which contains the data we
   use for most of the tasks.
