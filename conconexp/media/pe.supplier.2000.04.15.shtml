An ICORE module is comprised of (1) a single site, discrete, individually controllable heater sleeve containing a heating element and designed to accept a disposable reaction tube or cartridge, (2) an integrated cooling mechanism (e.g. a fan) that enables passage of ambient or cooled air across the heater sleeve, and (3) optical blocks containing solid state components that enable optical interrogation of the reaction solution in the reaction tube or cartridge. In a single site configuration comprised or a single ICORE module, the ICORE module will contain all of the elements listed above. In a multisite configuration comprised of multiple ICORE modules, each ICORE module: a) will contain a single site, discrete, individually controllable heater sleeve containing a heating element and designed to accept a disposable reaction tube or cartridge. b) may or may not contain an integrated cooling mechanism. If an integrated cooling mechanism is not included, each ICORE reaction site will be cooled by the passage of ambient or cooled air coming from an external source passing across the heater sleeve. c) may or may not contain optical blocks. If optical blocks are not included, the instrument will be optically &quot;blind&quot;, that is, it will not be capable of optical interrogation, or optical interrogation will occur on a separate module. 23 24 Exhibit 1a, page 1 [CEPHEID LOGO] BIOANALYSIS FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM RAPID THERMAL CYCLING WITH REALTIME DETECTION SMART CYCLER(R) SYSTEM The Smart Cycler(R) from Cepheid is a highly versatile and efficient thermal cycler with realtime optical detection specifically tailored to the rapidly evolving needs of today's molecular biology laboratory.
