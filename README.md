# Project Name

This project is the frontEnd of the project that have as purpose to do a Deep Learning Approach for Norm Conflict Identification.
it's a two-phase approach that uses traditional machine learning together with deep learning to extract and compare norms in order to identify conflicts between them.

## Dependencies
* We reccomend to install the dependencies with a virtual env from here 
* Django
* Python
* Mysql
* Mysql-python
* HomeBrew [Due to mysql-python needs]
* pypandoc
* scikit-learn [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html]
* numpy
* scipy
* nltk [http://www.nltk.org/install.html]
* keras][https://keras.io]
  * theano
  * pyyaml [have to have six, numpy and scipy, and keras will download this tree for you]
* upgrade tensorflow [https://www.tensorflow.org/install]
  * TensorFlow is the backend, upgrading it will download protobuf, pbr, funcsigs, mock, werkzeug, tensorflow 
  * If gives you this error: Resource u'tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle' not found.  Please
  use the NLTK Downloader to obtain the resource:  >>> nltk.download() do : sudo python -m nltk.downloader punkt 
 pip install h5py
 sudo pip install keras --upgrade
* [pdfminer.six] [will Running setup.py bdist_wheel for pycrypto and Successfully built pdfminer.six pycrypto
Installing collected packages: pycrypto, pdfminer.six]
