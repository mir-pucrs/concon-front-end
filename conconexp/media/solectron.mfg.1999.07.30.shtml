Productspecific requirements along with specific business terms and conditions with respect to each Product will be mutually agreed to and documented by an executed addendum to this Agreement. 1.2 It is the intent of the parties that this Agreement and its addenda shall prevail over the terms and conditions of any purchase order, acknowledgment form or other instrument. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms contained in any addenda to this Agreement, the terms of the addenda shall be controlling. Addenda shall not be binding until executed by authorized representatives of each party. 1.3 This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed the original, but all of which will constitute but one and the same document. The parties agree this Agreement and its addenda may not be modified except in writing signed by both parties. 1.4 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or deemed to prevent or otherwise inhibit Brocade's ability or right to manufacture, at Brocade's facility or at a third party facility of Brocade's choice, the Products. Further, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or deemed to (i) require Brocade to order any units of the Products to be manufactured by Solectron, or (ii) prevent or otherwise inhibit Brocade's ability or right to design, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, market, use, sell, and or distribute any followon products or derivatives of the Products. 2.0 TERM 2.1 The effective date of this Agreement shall be 7/30/, 1999 ("Effective Date"). This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue for an initial term of three (3) years. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for successive one (1) year renewal terms unless either party requests in writing, at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the thencurrent term, that this Agreement not be so renewed. 1 of 12 2 3.0 PRODUCT FORECAST 3.1 It is agreed that Brocade will provide Solectron, on a monthly basis, a nonbinding rolling twelve (12) month Product forecast.

While this document defines quality requirements that are the responsibility of Solectron, it is important to note that it is Brocade's intention to establish an open quality management relationship with Solectron. 2 SCOPE 2.1 The Quality System and Product Quality Requirements called out in this document are for the Fibre Channel Switches and associated printed circuit boards manufactured by Solectron. 2.2 Where the requirements called out in this document conflict with requirements called out elsewhere, the order of precedence is as follows: 2.2.1 Contractual agreements 2.2.2 Brocade Communications Purchase Order, Brocade Communications Engineering drawing or specification noted in the Purchase Order 2.2.3 This document 3 DEFINITIONS 3.1 Unless otherwise specified the terms used in this document are defined in: 3.1.1 ISO 84021986, Quality Vocabulary 3.1.2 ANSI/ASQC A31987, Quality Systems Terminology 3.2 Unit: In this document a unit is considered to be an assembled printed circuit board (e.g. a CPU board), a subassembly (e.g., power supply), a chassis, or a fully assembled switch made up of printed circuit boards, subassemblies, displays, and chassis. 4 RESPONSIBILITY 4.1 The Supply Base Engineer reporting to the Manager, Product and Process Quality in the Brocade CommunicationsOperations function is responsible for implementing the requirements of this document. 5 REFERENCE DOCUMENTS 5.1 ISO STANDARD 840 Quality Vocabulary 5.2 ISO 9000:1994 Quality management and quality assurance standards Guide lines for selection and use 5.3 ISO 9002:1994 Quality Systems Model for quality assurance in design/development, production, installation and servicing. 5.4 ANSI/ASQC A3 1987 Quality Systems Terminology 5.5 ANSI/ASQC Q1 1986 Guide Lines for Quality System Audits 5.6 MIL STD 105E Sampling procedures and Tables for inspection by Attributes 6 EQUIPMENT REQUIRED (HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE) (NONE REQUIRED) 7 QUALITY SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 7.1 Quality System Requirements: Brocade Communications' Quality System requirements are defined in the document ISO 9002:1994. Solectron's conformance to these requirements will be determined by a Quality Assessment organized by the Supply Base Engineer and carried out with the 23 assistance of other Brocade Communication groups. 24 7.1.1 Brocade Communications reserves the right to conduct, with proper notification, periodic reviews of Solectron's Process and Quality Control system. These reviews can include all aspects of materials management, manufacturing, test, and quality records associated with products and services sold or provided to Brocade Communications by Solectron. 7.2 If the Quality Assessment shows that Solectron is does not meet the ISO 9002 requirements, the deficiencies will be noted and corrective action may be required. (See the ANSI/ASQC Q1 1986: Guide Lines for Quality System Audits). 7.3 Process Definition: Prior to the start of production, Brocade Communications' Supply Base Engineer (SBE) and Solectron's representative will determine the key steps of the process flow. The key steps of the process flow will be documented using either Brocade's or Solectron's documentation. 7.4 Process Changes: Once the key process steps are defined, they can not be changed without written notification and approval from the Brocade Communications' Quality Engineer prior to the implementation of the changes. Examples of process changes are: using parts not called out on the Approved Vendor List (AVL), alterations to the agreed on process flow, changing pass/fail parameters, increasing or decreasing test times, changes in test equipment, relocation of the process to a different location, etc. 7.5 Process Reporting: Prior to the start of volume production Brocade Communications' Quality Engineer and Solectron's representative will agree on the content, format, and frequency of the Process Reports. 7.5.1 The Process Reports will include, at a minimum, yields at each operation, defect paretos at each operation, and corrective actions to address the significant defects. The reports will include data from the OnGoing Reliability Test and the OutOf the Box Audit (OOBA). 7.5.2 Brocade will, as far as practical, use Solectron's data collection process and reports, provided they meet Brocade's requirements. The data will be sent electronically. 7.6 Process Qualification and Improvement 7.7 Prior to the start of volume shipments the Brocade and Solectron will conduct a Product Verification Test (PVT). The PVT is a controlled build of a predetermined number of units with the purpose of demonstrating the capability of the process to produce defect free product in a cost efficient way. 7.7.1 The Brocade Quality Engineer and Solectron's representative will determine prior to the start of the volume production the target yield for the PVT build. 7.7.1.1 If the target yield is reached, the process is considered capable and ready for volume production. 7.7.1.2 If the target yield is not met, the Brocade Supply Base Engineer and Solectron's representative will jointly develop a corrective action plan to improve the process yield. When the corrective actions have been implemented, a second PVT build will be done. If this build meets the predetermined goals, the volume production can begin. If the yield is not met, the corrective action process will be duplicated until the predetermined yield criterion is reached. 7.7.2 Once volume production starts, the Brocade Supply Base Engineer and Solectron's representative will agree on a yield improvement plan. The Yield Improvement Plan (YIP) will set targets for quarterly yield or process improvements. If the quarterly goals are not reached, the Brocade and Solectron will determine what corrective actions are necessary to reach the quarterly goals. 7.8 OnGoing Reliability Test Brocade Communications uses an Ongoing Reliability Test (ORT) as a measure of the production process performance. Prior to the start of volume production Brocade's Supply Base Engineer and Solectron's representative will agree on the how the 25 Ongoing Reliability test will be implemented. The implementation will follow the guidelines called out in the Brocade Communications' Process number 99000040101 June 18, 1999 Page 3 of 4 Quality System and Product Quality Requirements 26 7.8.1 If there is a failure in the ORT, Solectron will immediately notify Brocade's Supply Base Engineer. Solectron's representative and Brocade's SBE will immediately start the failure analysis process and take any corrective action necessary. When the failure analysis is completed, the Brocade SBE will inform Brocade's Manager of Process and Product Quality of the findings and the status of the corrective action. 7.9 Failure Analysis: Solectron is required to do failure analysis on all inwarranty units returned from Brocade's customers. At Brocade's request Solectron is required to perform the first level failure analysis (determine the failed component) within one working day after receiving the failed unit. The rootcause analysis (analysis of the defective component) must be done within ten working days after the receipt of the failed unit. 7.10 Epidemic Failure: Epidemic failures are unit failures that are the result of defects in material, workmanship, and/or other deficiencies attributable to or within the control of Solectron, including but not limited to, incorrect use of components with inherent or latent defects, or consistent maladjustments during manufacture. The Epidemic Failure rate is defined as three times the Normal Annualized Failure rate specified in the Product Specification. 7.10.1 If the unit manufactured by Solectron for Brocade Communications is found to fail at an Epidemic rate, Solectron and Brocade Communications will mutually agree on a corrective action plan to be carried out by Solectron, at Solectron's expense to repair and replace the defective units. 7.11 Field Failure Rates as a Measure of Solectron Performance: Solectron's performance in delivering a quality product is determined by the Field Failure Rate and is measured as the Annualized Field Failure Rate. This is rate is calculated as the average number of returns over the last three months divided by the installed base, then multiplied by twelve to give an annualized rate. 7.11.1 If the Field Failure Rate of the unit manufactured by Solectron for Brocade Communications exceeds the Normal Annualized Failure Rate called out in the Product specification, Solectron and Brocade Communications will mutually implement a program to determine the root causes of the Field Failure Rate and implement corrective actions.
