# Conflict Types

### Different Deontic Meanings (DDM)
    
This type  of conflict consists of a simple modal verb modification from one norm to the other, as the following example shows:

- Company X **must** pay for every printed document.
- Company X **shall not** pay for a (every) printed document.

### Redundancy (RED)

In cases of duplication of norms, we consider it a redundancy type.

### Different Structure Different Deontic Meanings (DSDDM)

This type of conflict consists of two norms with different sentence structures and words but describing the same context. Thus, there is a conflict when the norms deontic meaning (prohibition, obligation, or permission) generates an impossibility of performing one without violating the other.

The following example illustrates the case:

- Company X **will** be responsible for collecting the excess of water from reservatories.
- Every excess of water found in the reservatories **shall not** be removed by Company X.

### Different Structure Same Deontic Meanings (DSSDM)

Similar to the previous type, this conflict occurs when we have a different structure in both norms but with the same deontic meanings. In this particular case, the conflict arises when the context described in one norm creates a conflict on the other. The following examle illustrates this case:

- Every Monday, the Company X manager must deliver in city Y.
- Company X manager shall keep in city W during business days.

### Conditional (COND)

In this type of conflict, we have the existance of a condition (as well as an exception) in a norm that conflicts with the definition of another norm.
The following pair of norms exemplify this conflict type:

- Except when previously defined, Company X shall deliver the products on Gate B.
- All products must be deliver by Company X on Gate B.

In this case, the conflict only happens if the excession occurs. Another example can be seen as follow:

- Company X may not pay taxes over products if it has more than two years of contributions.
- Company X shall pay all taxes over products.
